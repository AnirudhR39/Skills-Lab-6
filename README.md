# Skills-Lab-6
Group members are Layne Krantosky, Anirudh Rajesh, and Mohammad Mamnoon. Our group's code asks for the users name and birthday and prints it out.


This program takes in two inputs from the user (name and birthday) and then prints out the inputs.

You can install and use this program from the Github repository linked below:
https://github.com/AnirudhR39/Skills-Lab-6

To use this program, input your name and birthday in the provided input boxes

If you want to contribute to this program you can do so by adding a function that takes in the user's birthday and today's date and then calculates their age in years and then printing the results.
